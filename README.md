This project is a data processing pipeline for raw hyperspectral data for the Enviratron project. 

There are three primary files:
* **make_normalized_numpy_files.py** consumes raw hyperspectral data files and produces
.npy (numpy) files based on the raw data files. The produced numpy files contain data that has been reshaped. The raw file data is line scan data and data for each wavelength/band is dispersed throughout the file; in the numpy output files, bands/wavelengths are grouped and the data is contiguous. The numpy data is also calibrated using data from white and black reference data files. Examine the `main()` function in the file for more inforation.

*  **make_images_from_numpy_data.py** generated png images from the numpy data generated by **make_normalized_numpy_files.py**. These images are based on a single hyperspectral band. For each numpy file, the standard deviation is computed for each band and the band with the median standard deviation is used to generate the output image. Examine the `main()` function in the file for more information.

* **enviratron_filename_parser.py** contains a helper class for extracting metadata (created datetime, width, height, bands, etc) from the raw filenames.
